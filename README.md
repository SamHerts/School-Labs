# School-Labs
This is a collection of my class labs completed for my Computer Engineering Course. 
The CSIS courses are created from a template and run as a debugging program in Visual Studios 2017/2018/2019.
The ENGC course is created as a driver program for the Altera DE1-SOC FPGA board alongside the Linux driver OS.
