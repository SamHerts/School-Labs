Programming Assignment 3
LRU Buffer Pool
Implement a disk-based buffer pool class based on the LRU buffer pool replacement strategy.
This assignment comes from Project 8.3 on page 308 of your text. Using the supplied C++ files  to implement an LRU Buffer Pool.  I have made the following changes to Project 8.3:
•	Implement a BufferBlock class using the supplied BufferBlockADT.h
o	Your Buffer Block must inherit BufferBlockADT or you will not get credit for your work.
o	All BufferBlockADT virtual functions must be implemented in BufferBlock
o	Block Size: 4096
•	Implement a Buffer Pool by inheriting BufferPoolADT (BufferPoolADT.h) – implement all of BufferPoolADT’s functions (if you do not inherit BufferPoolADT you will not get credit for your work).
o	Your buffer pool should consist of 5 buffer blocks
o	Your buffer pool should manage the buffers using the LRU strategy
•	Use the provide main.cpp and the included test file mydatafile.txt to test your program.
File Provided:
•	BufferBlockADT.h 
•	BufferPoolADT.h
•	constants.h  (contains both constants and test function definitions)
•	main.cpp  (test program driver)
•	mydatafile.txt (input file for the test run)
Testing
Use main.cpp as the test driver and mydatafile.txt as the input file.

LRU Buffer Pool
Implement a disk-based buffer pool class based on the LRU buffer pool replacement strategy.
This assignment comes from Project 8.3 on page 308 of your text. Using the supplied C++ files  to implement an LRU Buffer Pool.  I have made the following changes to Project 8.3:
•	Implement a BufferBlock class using the supplied BufferBlockADT.h
o	Your Buffer Block must inherit BufferBlockADT or you will not get credit for your work.
o	All BufferBlockADT virtual functions must be implemented in BufferBlock
o	Block Size: 4096
•	Implement a Buffer Pool by inheriting BufferPoolADT (BufferPoolADT.h) – implement all of BufferPoolADT’s functions (if you do not inherit BufferPoolADT you will not get credit for your work).
o	Your buffer pool should consist of 5 buffer blocks
o	Your buffer pool should manage the buffers using the LRU strategy
•	Use the provide main.cpp and the included test file mydatafile.txt to test your program.
